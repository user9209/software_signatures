# Software Signatures

This repo is for sharing signatures about software.

It does not secure that the software is without maleware,

but you can check if you copy of the software has the same hash.

# Not matched or no sign?

Feel free to make pull requests with our own signatures of some tools.

If a signature does not match, take a look if the version is different. If you think the sign is wrong, please report it as issue. Thanks in advance.

# This signatures only compare the files.

# This means, the software can still contain maleware.

# This only ensures hopefully, that all downloads are the same

You can download your software from a unsecure provider and hopefully the signature should be the same.
